## Issues
- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- For bugs, include reproduction steps and screenshots/logs.

## Pull requests
- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Link issues using auto-close keywords so GitHub closes the issue on merge:
  - `Fixes #123`, `Closes #123`, or `Resolves #123`
- Describe what changed, why, and how it was tested.

## Code style
- Follow existing patterns and formatting.
- Prefer clear names over clever code.
